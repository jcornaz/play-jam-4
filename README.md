# LiftUp!

This is a tiny tiny game made for the play-jam 4. You can download it here: https://jomag.itch.io/liftup

You play a mouse trying to escape the water by talking lifts. Better hurry cause the water is rising!

But you must first collect the key to unlock the next lift.

### Controls

* **D-pad**: move (left-right)
* **A**: jump
* **Crank**: lift up (only when on the lift)

**NOT TESTED ON REAL DEVICE**, as I haven't received mine yet :'-(
